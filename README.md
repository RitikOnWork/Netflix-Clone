🎬 Netflix Landing Page Clone (HTML & CSS Only)

This project is a static clone of the official Netflix landing page, built entirely using HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript, frameworks (like React or Bootstrap), or third-party libraries.

🔧 Project Overview:
The goal was to recreate the sleek, modern design of Netflix’s homepage and practice front-end skills by building the layout from scratch. It includes all the key visual elements found on the real site:

Header with Netflix logo and "Sign In" button

Hero Section featuring a full-screen background image, main heading, subheading, and an email input form

Feature Sections with alternating text and image layout

FAQ Section styled to resemble expandable questions (static in this version)

Footer mimicking Netflix’s real-world link layout and design

📱 Responsive Design:
Special attention was given to making the layout responsive using Flexbox and media queries. The design adapts smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and usability on all devices.

🎯 Core Objectives:

Practice building real-world UIs with semantic HTML structure
